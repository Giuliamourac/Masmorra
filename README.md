# 🩸 Fear & Hunger - Console RPG

Fear & Hunger is a dark, text-based RPG developed in C#, inspired by dungeon-crawling and survival mechanics.
The game focuses on turn-based encounters, character attributes, and player choice.

Players select a character, each with unique stats such as health, strength, defense, and luck, and explore a hostile dungeon filled with dangerous enemies.
The project emphasizes object-oriented programming, using inheritance, encapsulation, and clean class design to manage characters, enemies, and game logic.

This project is a learning-focused game, built to practice C# fundamentals, game structure, and scalable code architecture.
